# bienesraices-api
This is a project where I am learning Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and practicing the model-view-controller  architecture. In this project, I have been creating user routers and implementing form validation. Additionally, I have been working on establishing a connection between Sequelize and PostgreSQL.
